# Pump.fun

Pump.fun is a launchpad for meme tokens on Solana. **PUMP** is its native token. Part of the platform’s revenue goes to buy-backs, reducing supply.

 Pros

* **Meme coin popularity** — Solana is a leader in launches.
* **Buy-back model** — supports price by shrinking circulating supply.
* **Growing activity** — rising revenue and token launches.
* **Community & hype** — key drivers in the meme sector.

 Cons

* **High volatility** — price swings are extreme.
* **Trend dependency** — meme hype could fade.
* **Regulatory risks & manipulation concerns.**
* **Large holders** — whales could dump and crash price.


 Scenarios

* **Optimistic:** strong leadership + hype → +50–100% growth or more.
* **Base case:** slower growth → price fluctuates ±30–50%.
* **Pessimistic:** declining interest/regulation → heavy correction.
